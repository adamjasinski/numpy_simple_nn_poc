    Load and return the MNIST dataset for training and testing.

    Returns:
    - X_train (numpy.ndarray): Training set, a 3D array of shape (num_samples, 28, 28),
      where num_samples is the number of training samples.
    - y_train (numpy.ndarray): Training labels, a 1D array of shape (num_samples,) containing
      the corresponding class labels for the training images.
    - X_test (numpy.ndarray): Test set, a 3D array of shape (num_samples, 28, 28),
      where num_samples is the number of test samples.
    - y_test (numpy.ndarray): Test labels, a 1D array of shape (num_samples,) containing
      the corresponding class labels for the test images.

    Example usage:

    >>> print("Training labels shape:", y_train.shape)
